I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisor, Dr. Thang N. Bui, for his guidance, ideas and patience throughout the thesis  process.  I am very grateful to the members of the thesis committee for reviewing this work and also enduring its defense. I would like to thank all my friends, for their feedback along the way and for distracting me when I needed it. Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their love and support throughout, without which I would not have been where I am today.
